This is a client only release which gives you the new HEAT multi-currency wallet manager.

Gradually we'll be adding more cryptocurrencies starting with this release for Ethereum
and the Ethereum ERC20 tokens.

An update to the HEAT twelve-word secret phrase generator was applied making HEAT seeds
compatible with BIP39 [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki].

Your HEAT seed now also becomes the basis for your Ethereum and Bitcoin HD wallets.

So thats one 12-word phrase giving you access to all your crypto holdings.

The Ethereum part of the wallet manager is implemented on top of https://github.com/ConsenSys/eth-lightwallet/
which implements a HD wallet and gives you an endless list of addresses all derived
from a single seed.

ERC20 tokens sending feature is under development still and will follow soon.

What is supported is the display of your token balances (HEAT Assets & ERC20 tokens), the
display of your transaction history (ABI aware transaction details which means transaction
details are parsed from the raw transaction.input - supported ABI's are expected to increase).

Most of the development work has been for behind the scenes stuff like remaking the client
structure to support multiple different currencies and updates to the wallet structure,
however experienced HEAT users will notice still quite a lot changed. The new
wallet manager screen is no doubt the largest visual update.

We hope you'll enjoy this release.
